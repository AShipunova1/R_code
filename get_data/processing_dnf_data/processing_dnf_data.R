# The result will be in

# For this analysis, a week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.

# Files to read or create:
# 1) Raw_Oracle_Downloaded_compliance_2021_plus.rds
# 2) Raw_Oracle_Downloaded_dnf_{my_date_beg}__{my_date_end}.rds
# 3) SEFHIER_permitted_vessels_nonSRHS_{my_year}.rds
       # use processing_metrics_tracking.R to create file #3 before running this script
#4) processing_auxiliary_methods.R
       # get from Google Drive R code folder (R code / Processed data, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U5cYuEGITcHrwDLgkHtyMvoUsS7nZeONyHt2yelpbNA/edit?usp=drive_link), put in path directory with this script

# This code processes DNF data from Oracle database ready for FHIER,
# then cleans it up, so that we can use it in any DNF data analysis:
# (1) (a) pull all DNF and compliance/override data from Oracle database
#     (b) get Metrics Tracking from FHIER
# (2) clean up DNF data set
#     (a) remove records from SRHS vessels
# (3) remove all overridden data.
# We have to remove dnfs for weeks that were overridden because we don't have a timestamp for when the dnf was submitted to the app, only when it was submitted to Oracle/SAFIS, and we can't differentiate that time laps.
# We can't differentiate between turning a dnf in on time in the app, and it taking two months to get it vs turning in a dnf two months late.
# E.g. user submitted Jan 1, 2022, but SEFHIER team found it missing in FHIER (and SAFIS) in March, 2022 (At permit renewal)... user submitted on time in app (VESL) but we may not get that report in SAFIS for months later (when its found as a "missing report" and then requeued for transmission)
# (4) mark all trips neg that were received > 30 days after trip end date, by using time of submission

# For 2022 we don't keep trips neg starting in 2021 and ending in 2022. We only keep trips neg starting in 2022.

# Caveats:
# 1) The way COMP_WEEK is calculated could get messed up depending on a given year time frame. It's due to something
# internal called the ISO number and how the function calculates the start of a week. If you are running this on a
# new data set, check your weeks to make sure it's calculating correctly.

# Running the code
# To run the file as a whole, you can type this in the console: source('processing_dnf_data.R') and hit enter.
# Pressing F2 when the custom function name is under the cursor will show the function definition.
# Pressing F1 when the R function name is under the cursor will show the function definition and examples in the help panel.

# happen overnight on a Sunday, it might affect what week they are assigned to
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60475358/convert-daily-data-into-weekly-data-in-r

# Calculate the ISO week number for each date in the 'TRIP_DATE2' column.
# lubridate package has following methods:
# week() returns the number of complete seven day periods that have occurred between the date and January 1st, plus one.
#
# isoweek() returns the week as it would appear in the ISO 8601 system, which uses a reoccurring leap week.
#
# epiweek() is the US CDC version of epidemiological week. It follows same rules as isoweek() but starts on Sunday. In other parts of the world the convention is to start epidemiological weeks on Monday, which is the same as isoweek.

# We have decided to throw out dnfs that were submitted when the permit was inactive, the logic
# being we shouldn't include dnfs that weren't required in the first place. Alternatively,
# deciding to keep in the NAs means we would be keeping reports that were submitted by a vessel
# during a period in which the permit was inactive, and the report was not required.
# rbind(dnfs_notoverridden__w_missing, dnfs_NA) this is the alternative

# add a date 30 days later and set time to 23:59:59

# Explanations:
# 1. Use 'mutate' to create a new column named 'USABLE_DATE_TIME' by adding 30 days to the 'TRIP_DATE_E' column.
# 2. Use the `hour<-` function from lubridate package to set the hour component of 'USABLE_DATE_TIME' to 23.
# 3. Use 'mutate' to update 'USABLE_DATE_TIME' with the hour modification.
# 4. Use the `minute<-` function from lubridate package to set the minute component of 'USABLE_DATE_TIME' to 59.
# 5. Use 'mutate' to update 'USABLE_DATE_TIME' with the minute modification.
# 6. Use the `second<-` function from lubridate package to set the second component of 'USABLE_DATE_TIME' to 59.
# 7. Use 'mutate' to update 'USABLE_DATE_TIME' with the second modification.
