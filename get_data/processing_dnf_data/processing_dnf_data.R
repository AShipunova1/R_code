# This code processes DNF data from Oracle database ready for FHIER,
# then cleans it up, so that we can use it in any DNF data analysis:
# (1) (a) pull all DNF and compliance/override data from Oracle database
#      (b) get Metrics Tracking from FHIER
# (2) clean up DNF data set
#      (a) remove records from SRHS vessels
# (3) mark all trips neg that were received > 30 days after trip end date, by using time of #submission
# (4) remove all overridden data, because the submission date is unknown
# (5) Add permit region information (GOM, SA, or dual), using permit names (optional)

# For 2022 we don't keep trips neg starting in 2021 and ending in 2022. We only keep trips neg starting in 2022.

# Caveats:
# 1) The way COMP_WEEK is calculated could get messed up depending on a given year time frame. It's due to something
# internal called the ISO number and how the function calculates the start of a week. If you are running this on a
# new data set, check your weeks to make sure it's calculating correctly.

# Running the code
# To run the file as a whole, you can type this in the console: source('Processing DNF Data.R') and hit enter.
# Pressing F2 when the custom function name is under the cursor will show the function definition.
# Pressing F1 when the R function name is under the cursor will show the function definition
# and examples in the help panel.

### reformat trip date ----
# Explanation:
#
# 1. **Create New Dataframe:**
#    - `dnfs <- dnfs |> ...`: Create a new dataframe 'dnfs' by using the pipe operator '|>' on the existing 'dnfs'.
#
# 2. **Use 'mutate' to Convert Columns:**
#    - `mutate(across(..., as.Date))`: Utilize the 'mutate' function with 'across' to apply a transformation to multiple columns.
#
# 3. **Column Selection with 'across':**
#    - `c(!where(is.Date) & ends_with("_DATE"))`: Select columns that meet the specified conditions:
#      - `!where(is.Date)`: Columns that are not already of type 'Date'.
#      - `ends_with("_DATE")`: Columns whose names end with "_DATE".
#
# 4. **Convert Columns to Date:**
#    - `as.Date`: Use the 'as.Date' function to convert the selected columns to the 'Date' format.

### Prepare data to determine what weeks were overridden, so we can exclude dnfs from those weeks later ----

# assign each dnf a week designation (first day of the reporting week is a Monday)
# use the end date to calculate this, it won't matter for most trips, but for some trips neg that
# happen overnight on a Sunday, it might affect what week they are assigned to
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60475358/convert-daily-data-into-weekly-data-in-r

# Calculate the ISO week number for each date in the 'TRIP_DATE2' column.
# lubridate package has following methods:
# week() returns the number of complete seven day periods that have occurred between the date and January 1st, plus one.
#
# isoweek() returns the week as it would appear in the ISO 8601 system, which uses a reoccurring leap week.
#
# epiweek() is the US CDC version of epidemiological week. It follows same rules as isoweek() but starts on Sunday. In other parts of the world the convention is to start epidemiological weeks on Monday, which is the same as isoweek.
