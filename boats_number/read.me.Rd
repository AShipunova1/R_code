(Anna) Information to highlight movement patterns of the Gulf for-hire fleet;

how many SEFHIER vessels start at a different location than they end;

how many vessels have variable landing locations (i.e., in the winter they are in one state while in the summer they fish in another);

we should look at this by quarter, to start - for some seasonality.

quantify the # of vessels who fish in both the gulf and S Atl. ;

look at permit homeport vs where they take trip.


The number of boats participating in each fishery;
do the top species;
do vessels and # trips;
and average trip per vessel;
and look at seasonality.  Break into quarters, or try the ACL page and determine when things open and close.
Is there a place to grab a list of "top species"?  No, there is no list of 'top species,' and it is challenging as top will differ by weight vs number.  Dominique did it for the private angler in the SA by summing it all together and looking at top species by total catch, total landings and in number and weight.  Since we only have number, that should probably be our metric.  We should look by both total catch and total landings. Ask Dominique for her code to see if you can steal anything already done.

(Show previous analysis) Proportion of vessels intercepted during dock-side validation; from old email.
I think use what we did for the Council, we really can't get more refined than that.
(Michelle) The Council wanted a tabulation of any vessel that indicated what species they were targeting.
I can adapt my target species caught by quarter figure to output a DF that is tabulated by quarter and species-level instead.
(OLE) What proportion of vessels that hailed-out and provided a logbook were also intercepted at the dock, and what areas were the most arduous for compliance.
maybe we just go qualitative and ask OLE where they had to do the most outreach?  Feel free to ask Dominique for any code adaptions (I can't remember what she did on this).


(Anna) identifying any particular areas of high non-compliance to help focus future outreach efforts.
