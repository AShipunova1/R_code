# We have a request that is going to require some new coding, but it shouldn't be too difficult. Essentially SC (Eric Hiltz) sends us a list of active SC/SEFHIER permitted vessels each month, which Anna has been using to update the FHIER flag ("SC permitted"). Eric will still be sending us that same list of vessels each month but with added columns that now reflect whether the vessel is compliant or not (0 or 1, respectively). Note, we still need to use the list to update FHIER but we need to add a couple new items to the task.
#
# So, in addition to updating FHIER, we need to create code that can do two things:
#
# read in this file of SC/SEFHIER vessel IDs for the given month (e.g. March 2024) and then pull out all vessels marked as "1" (non-compliant) - herein, "SC non-compliant vessels list". Then with that SC non-compliant vessel list we need to join//find all those vessels that are in the FHIER compliance table and create an output file that consists of a check that we will send back to Eric. In the check/output file we need, (sheet 1) the list of those SC non-compliant vessels that are also non-compliant in FHIER, or (on sheet 2) if they are compliant for that month in FHIER then list all the dates of DNFs and/or logbooks we have in FHIER by vessel (probably 3 columns needed: vessel ID, Logbook (list any dates for that month), DNF (list week date range for any for that month)
# we also need a step that just grabs the compliant vessels (herein "SC compliant vessels list"), and then checks FHIER compliance to see if any that SC has as compliant are listed as non-compliant for any of the weeks in the given month. If any vessels are found to be compliant with SC but non-compliant with us/FHIER, then we need (on a 3rd sheet) to list those vessels and include what week (with date ranges) we are missing in FHIER. Eric will use this to more proactively alert us when a vessel is reporting only to SC, since we have so many recurring issues with this.
# If you have time or would like to attempt writing this code let me know ASAP. Ideally, I would like to have this operational by the next time Eric sends his list (which is usually the beginning of every month). I can start writing the code this week, if neither of you has time.
