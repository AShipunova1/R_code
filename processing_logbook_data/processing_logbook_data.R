# processing_logbook_data

#This code processes logbook data from Oracle, then cleans it up, so that we can use it in any logbook data analysis:
  #(1) pull all logbook and compliance data from Oracle
  #(2) clean up logbook data set, using Metrics Tracking and SRHS list
       #(a) remove records from SRHS vessels
       #(b) remove records from vessels without a GOM SEFHIER permit
       #(c) remove records where start date/time is after end date/time
       #(d) remove records for trips lasting more than 10 days
       #(e) only keep A, H and U logbooks for GOM permitted vessels (U because VMS allows Unknown Trip Type)
  #(3) remove all trips that were received > 30 days after trip end date, by using compliance data and time of submission

# Caveats:
# 1) The way COMP_WEEK is calculated could get messed up depending on a given year time frame. It's due to something
# internal called the ISO number and how the function calculates the start of a week. If you are running this on a
# new data set, check your weeks to make sure it's calculating correctly after running that line of code.

# Separate GOM only, SA only or dual using PERMIT_GROUP ----

# Use 'mutate' to create a new column 'permit_sa_gom' with categories based on permit group

# Check if 'permit_group_field_name' doesn't contain 'RCG', 'HRCG', 'CHG', or 'HCHG'; assign "sa_only" if true
# Check if 'permit_group_field_name' doesn't contain 'CDW', 'CHS', or 'SC'; assign "gom_only" if true
# For all other cases, assign "dual"

# Explanation:
#
# 1. **Create New Dataframe:**
#    - `SEFHIER_logbooksAHU_usable_regions <- SEFHIER_logbooksAHU_usable %>% ...`: Create a new dataframe 'SEFHIER_logbooksAHU_usable_regions' based on the 'SEFHIER_logbooksAHU_usable' dataframe.
#
# 2. **Use 'mutate' to Add Column:**
#    - `mutate(permit_sa_gom = dplyr::case_when(...))`: Utilize the 'mutate' function to add a new column 'permit_sa_gom' with values determined by the conditions specified in the 'case_when' function.
#
# 3. **Conditions with 'case_when':**
#    - `!grepl("RCG|HRCG|CHG|HCHG", PERMIT_GROUP) ~ "sa_only"`: If 'PERMIT_GROUP' does not contain the specified patterns, assign "sa_only".
#    - `!grepl("CDW|CHS|SC", PERMIT_GROUP) ~ "gom_only"`: If 'PERMIT_GROUP' does not contain the specified patterns, assign "gom_only".
#    - `.default = "dual"`: For any other case, assign "dual".
#
# 4. **'dplyr::' Prefix:**
#    - `dplyr::case_when(...)`: Prefix 'dplyr::' is used to explicitly specify that the 'case_when' function is from the 'dplyr' package, ensuring there is no ambiguity if other packages also have a 'case_when' function.
