# Compare catch in survey vs logbook

# we will need to start looking at catch in comparison to the validation survey and to what MRIP is reporting. I think the 3 of us can start working on this together, but for now - Anna if you can create some code to pull catch by species. So, you'd need to ID the breath of species caught in all logbooks (2022+). Do this by region (gulf vs s atl vessels). Then the total caught (numbers) for each unique species. THen we will move to comparing it to the Validation survey data and MRIP. I have validation survey data outputs, that I have not touched yet - no idea the format. I don't know how to get MRIP estimates, but we can figure it out together.

# All logbook data can be downloaded using FHIER (sometimes lags out), ROracle or SQL developer. I actually just pulled the logbook data yesterday, with ROracle, for a data request. I just put it in the google folder here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iBSiEt30DkTrzzijOb6IuZwQ1r5zvqhs), where I created some new code for the economist who requested an analysis. It's a big file, so it may not show up in there until later today or tomorrow.
