Michelle,

The one species group where it would really help to include trips discarding HMS would be for trips discarding billfish (blue and white marlin and sailfish). The fishery for those species is highly catch and release, so excluding discards would severely undercount them. That said, if you included targeted trips, you might catch most of them anyways.

And 10-4 on the VESL trips. They have been working to get the HMS catch reporting data elements integrated into VESL, so we are hoping that issue will be resolved soon, but we understand that data will be missing for previous years.  

HMS Species List
Bluefin Tuna
Yellowfin Tuna
Bigeye Tuna
Skipjack Tuna
Albacore Tuna
Blue Marlin
White Marlin
Sailfish
Swordfish
Plus all shark species, although the most common in the southeast will be Atlantic sharpnose, bonnetheads, blacktip, spinner, and bull

I don't think that is necessary, I would just filter the logbooks for HMS species. This way you get a vessel whether its HMS permitted or not. Could you provide the list, just so I am sure I have the most accurate/current list of species? Also, just double checking you only want those targeting or landing (retaining), and not anything on those that are catching (but discarding)? SEFHIER collects caught and discarded, by species. 

**the data caveat , that we don't get VESL logbooks when they report retaining or discarding HMS will particular bias the Gulf data. VESL users make up > 65% of the logbooks we get front he Gulf. Just an FYI.

Michelle,

Yes, this essentially summarizes what we are looking for, although we also want to know the total number of trips (HMS plus non-HMS trips) taken by vessels that ever reported targeting/landing HMS within the year. It would be helpful to have this analysis done separately for the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico given the current status of the program in the Gulf. That way we can address what the potential overlap would be if the Gulf program is reinstated, versus if it is not.

One other option to consider, when we submitted this same request to GARFO, they asked us to provide a list of HMS permitted vessels that they could cross reference to expedite their analysis. I could provide that vessel list to you as well if that would be of help. Thanks for all your assistance.

Hi Cliff, 

I have a couple clarifying points. In reviewing the requests, I just want to be sure I have restated what you are after - in a quantitative way (i.e., how we'd analyze it). Also, could you confirm if you need this for both the Gulf and S. Atl, or just one or the other? If both, do you need the outputs separated by region? What about the timeframe (i.e., just 2022, which is when the Gulf program was still standing; 2022 & 2023)?

Important caveats (SEFHIER does not receive VESL logbook data, when they report HMS species - as they are blocked by SAFIS; landed = retained catch here) 
Requested (please revise as needed):
the # of trips that targeted or retained HMS out of the total trips, by year and region.  
How many vessels retained HMS, by year and region
The average number of trips targeting and retaining HMS species, out of the total trips by vessels that targeted or retained HMS. Do this by year and region.

Great - thanks! I will reach out with any questions, otherwise I will send it to you all by the 16th.

Michelle,

February 16th would work fine for us, especially given your current workload. Thanks so much for the assistance!

Hi Cliff, 

I hope your new year is also off to a good start! Regarding if we can provide the requested info, the answer is we can definitely check the data and (based on past analyses) most likely we can provide the requested info. However, myself and my 2 analysts are currently focused on producing analyses requested for the March S Atl. Council meeting, and our internal deadline for that is also Feb 9th. 

It's possible that I can get to it by your requested deadline, but (1) I am currently on page 62 of 231, in reviewing our team manual - in prep for our new team members to train from (next week), (2) the Gulf Council meeting is next week, I am presenting, and I am needing to produce figures for the S. Atl. Council presentation by the 9th, and (3) what you request will require writing new code, so it's not something I can do without some time to focus on coding it up. Can we extend the requested deadline to "by Feb 16th"? I can endeavor to get it to you before then, but that would give me a more realistic window.

Cheers,
Michelle

Jessica and Michelle,

I hope the new year is finding you both well. As you are aware, Atlantic HMS is working on an electronic reporting rulemaking that is considering expanding logbook reporting requirements to all of our HMS Charter/Headboat permit holders. We are aiming to have a proposed rule published in early summer. I am working on our burden analyses for the rulemaking, and the associated PRA revision that will be required. There is a key piece of data we need that I was hoping you could assist us with.

Like the other logbook programs, we would require our permit holders to report all trips, not just HMS trips. While we have data sources that could help us to get at the number of HMS trips taken by our permit holders, it's a little harder to get at all the trips they take within a year. We were hoping you could help us with this. In some recent presentations, I saw you presented the percentage of trips reported to SEFHIER that targeted or landed HMS. Would it be possible for you to identify vessels that reported HMS landings in 2022, and calculate the average number of total trips (for all species) they reported within the year? If you could also get us the average number of trips landing or targeting HMS by these vessels that would be useful as well to check against our other data sources. 

Would it be possible to get us these figures by February 9th? Let us know if you have any questions.

Best,
Cliff Hutt
