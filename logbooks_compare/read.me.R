# Comparing the logbook to logbook data between the Validation Survey and the logbooks in FHIER
# From Michelle:
# For the Survey to FHIER logbook comparison, we want to compare the accuracy/inaccuracy, at a trip level. So, are they sending us the same information that they reported to the Surveyor? We'll need to estimate any differences at trip-level reporting, and quantify those differences (if any) across all trips. Just use 2022 data for now.
