# GOM - should be equal # of decl and logb  
# For SA, they need either a no fishing report weekly (due Tuesday following the fishing week, which is Mon-Sun) or they need a logbook for every fishing trip (so at least 1 per week if no fishing report is submitted)
## non-compliant vessels for the GOM, if 65 vessels are missing 1 report (1) is that a missing declaration or logbook?, (2) how many did they submit correctly (e.g. this month in question maybe they are missing 1 logbook, but they submitted 20. So, 1/20 = 5% missing). That is a vessel level, so then perhaps take the average of all for the month, and then the year, by region, and plot it that way.
