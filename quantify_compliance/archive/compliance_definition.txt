"To Be Compliant (for data before week 9 of 2023)"
GOM:
1) There should be a declaration for every logbook (in another words, the number of fishing intended charter declarations would need to be equal to logbooks to be compliant)
<!-- 2) There could be no logbooks for a declaration if it is recreational ("non-fishing intended, recreational declaration") or not a charter
I'd take out rule 2. Having a logbook submitted for a recreational or non-fishing intended charter declaration isn't required but wouldn't make them non-compliant if they did submit it by accident. -->

2) declarations can be submitted no more than 30 days in advance

SA:
1) There should be at least one logbook or one DNFs filed for any given week except the last one (can submit the following Tuesday).
2) DNFs should not be submitted more than 30 days in advance

Dual:
Before week 9 of 2023, dual permitted vessels had followed GOM reqs.

All:
Noncompliant + overridden are compliant
