# !Different amount of vessels per period
# Use "expected counts" for SA

# Michelle:
# I like the visualization approach. So this is showing # of vessels with # of missing reports? I'd like to consider more as a proportion of how many they have missing vs how many they have done correctly. So, if we look at a month of non-compliant vessels for the GOM, if 65 vessels are missing 1 report (1) is that a missing declaration or logbook?, (2) how many did they submit correctly (e.g. this month in question maybe they are missing 1 logbook, but they submitted 20. So, 1/20 = 5% missing). That is a vessel level, so then perhaps take the average of all for the month, and then the year, by region, and plot it that way. Does that make sense? The main question is to see how usable the data is, i.e., if they are submitting most of the reports then its still good data. So we need to determine that.
#
# Also, if 65 vessels had 0 reports submitted how many reports should they have submitted? What does the 0 mean for a GOM vessel, when a GOM vessel doesn't need to submit reports?

# 03/24/2023
# > What does the 0 mean for a GOM vessel, when a GOM vessel doesn't need to submit reports?
# Just that, there were 0 reports and the vessel marked as non_compliant
# that seems odd. We should probably look into why this is happening for a Gulf vessel. But low priority since the Gulf program is now set aside.
# >  if 65 vessels had 0 reports submitted how many reports should they have submitted?
#   There is no "expected" amount for GOM, right?
#   correct. In the GOM, they are only required to declare IF they move on water (or they submitted a logbook), and only submit a logbook IF they declared they intended to fish.
# For SA, they need either a no fishing report weekly (due Tuesday following the fishing week, which is Mon-Sun) or they need a logbook for every fishing trip (so at least 1 per week if no fishing report is submitted)
# > So this is showing # of vessels with # of missing reports?
# # of vessels with # of submitted reports for non_compliant vessels only
# that would be for Gulf then? For SA they are non-compliant if no reports were submitted
#
# One more thing to consider, each month will have a slightly different number of vessels, should we take it into account?
#   no, that is expected due to fluctuations in permit statuses. We just need to look at this month by month, and annually - to address the data usability concern.
