\title{Quantify compliance read.me}
quantify program compliance for Gulf and dual Gulf/SA permitted vessels. She thinks we'll need those estimates for trying to stand the Gulf program back up

Michelle Masi - NOAA Federal, Now
some caveats I have run into, in trying to quantify - are that folks may be missing 1 of 100 reports (e.g.) and that makes them non-compliant at the time you pull the compliance report data

so, perhaps looking at the proportion of reports submitted vs flags... speaking of, not sure if Yanets FHIER modifications (turning off Gulf compliance errors, following the lawsuit) impacted existing compliance errors. I am guessing it must have wiped them all... hmm, that would make this challenging

it would be the same compliance report we used in the egregious code

some will be easy to map (e.g. "food, personal use"  - those would be "catch"; "released alive" = released)
oh, actually those definitions tell you the odd ones. e.g. "other" does = discard (so released)

so, maybe you can just map them yourself, without discussion, using that website. Let me know if you are unsure of any though
