\title{Quantify compliance read.me}
quantify program compliance for Gulf and dual Gulf/SA permitted vessels. She thinks we'll need those estimates for trying to stand the Gulf program back up

Michelle Masi - NOAA Federal, Now
some caveats I have run into, in trying to quantify - are that folks may be missing 1 of 100 reports (e.g.) and that makes them non-compliant at the time you pull the compliance report data
proportion of trip_submitted
no reports - compliant? look at # of reports
2022 - 90% compliance, but what about # of reports
look at late submitting: how many people are submitting reports on time
trip happen vs day submission lag (logbooks, declaration datatable)
GOM and SA separately
30 day window for submission



so, perhaps looking at the proportion of reports submitted vs flags... speaking of, not sure if Yanets FHIER modifications (turning off Gulf compliance errors, following the lawsuit) impacted existing compliance errors. I am guessing it must have wiped them all... hmm, that would make this challenging

it would be the same compliance report we used in the egregious code

I would just stick with the weekly, then aggregate compliance weeks into 4 week chunks (we'll call those ~ months), then into annual.

31/05/2023
SA only permit vessels
for 2022 dual were as GOM
1 per week: logbook or no fishing report:
at least 4 per weeks

For example: for January plot for each week
compl / non compl

How many non compl in each week
100% - the total of non compliance vessels for a given month% of submit of 1 week, 2 weeks
prop of weeks w report is missing

Gulf and dual 2022
Compl, non compl - even number
by week
